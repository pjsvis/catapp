Code Review Notes

1. The account patch does not return a promise so I am not sure how to chain the success and failure methods.
2. The success and failure methods in personal details are sent in through props. Should we do this with the smart prefs form?
3. The onSubmit method is lifted up into the props of the parent component for its implementation. Once there it can only be run in-line to maintain the scope of the values.
